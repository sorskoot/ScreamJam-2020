Story:
    - Wake up near your car upside down
    - Explore the garage
    - Hear airstrike, is it war?
    - Only exit is the emergency exit
    - Light that flashes on when entering the staircase. 
    - 'scary` coat and hat hanging there
    - go upstairs
    - Another airstrike, with a monster? 
    - only exit is blocked after strike
    - new exit is opened up in the wall
    - entering a small corridor
    - the exit closest seems to be blocked
    - you enter a door at the end
    - objects seem to float and fall to the ground when you enter
    - another airstike 
    - moving through another door
    - it seems to be a dead end
    - more airstrike and object start floating again
    - growling monsters
    - the world turns white
    - and then black
